For ($i=0; $i -lt 5; $i++) {
   Write-Host "The current iteration is $i."
}

# ForEach Loop...
# Iterates over a collection extracting each element in sequence.
$array = "Bryan", "Joe", "Steve", "Sue", "Mary"
Foreach ($item in $array)
{
   Write-Host "The current name is: $item."
}

# ForEach-Object...
Get-ChildItem  | ForEach-Object { Write-Host ("File Name is: " + $_.FullName) }

# While Loop...
$x = 0
While ($x -lt 5) {
   Write-Host $x
   $X++
}

# Do While Loop...
$val = 0
Do {
  $val++
  Write-Host $val
} While($val -lt 5) #  Condition applied after block is executed!

$val = 0
Do {
  $val++
  Write-Host $val
} Until($val -gt 5)

# Impicit Loop, the pipe...
Get-Process | Select-Object -Property "Id", "ProcessName", "CPU(s)"

# Do Until Loop...
$val = 0
Do {
  $val++
  Write-Host $val

  If ($val -eq 8)
  {
    "Interupting Loop"
    Break
  }
} While($val -ne 10)


# Real World Example...

# While Loop...
$RandomNumber = Get-Random -minimum 1 -maximum 100
$KeepTrying = "Y"
while($KeepTrying.ToUpper() -eq "Y") {
       $Guess = Read-Host "Enter your guess"
       If ($Guess -eq $RandomNumber)
       {
        "You Win!"
       }
       Else
       {
         "Sorry Wrong Number."
         $KeepTrying = Read-Host "Want to try again?"
       }
}
